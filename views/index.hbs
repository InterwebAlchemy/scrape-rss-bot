    <h1>I'm a bot. I make RSS feeds for Slack Channels.</h1>
    <p>Tired of missing links in your Slack Channels? Just add me to a channel and whenever a user posts a link, they'll be asked if they want to add it to the channel's RSS Feed.</p>
    <p>Once you add the feed to your RSS Reader of choice, you'll be all set.</p>
