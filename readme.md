# RSS Bot for Slack

`@RSS` was built using [Botkit](https://botkit.ai).

Once you add `@RSS` to a channel in your Slack Workspace, it
will listen for any links that are posted.

When a user posts a link, they will be asked if they want to
add that link to the RSS Feed for that channel.

Each channel that `@RSS` is in will get it's own RSS Feed.

Any user can get the RSS Feed URL for the current channel by
using the `/rssfeed` slash command.
